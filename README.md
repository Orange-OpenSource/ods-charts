## Quick start

Several quick start options are available:

- npm installation:
  - Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install ods-charts`
  - Use in your js files : `import * as ODSCharts from 'ods-charts';`
- Add javascript tag in your HTML page:

```html
<script src=" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts@latest/dist/echarts.min.js "></script>
```

The ODS Charts library is to be used with Apache ECharts to create charts that adhere to the Orange Design System guidelines.

It has been designed to be minimally intrusive and not to interfere with the use of the Apache ECharts library. The Apache ECharts documentation remains the reference for configuring charts.

For example, an Apache Echarts user will initialize a graph with code like this:

```javascript
var div = document.getElementById('barLine_chart');
var myChart = echarts.init(div, undefined, {
  renderer: 'svg', // SVG is recommended
});
// display the chart.
myChart.setOption(dataOptions);
```

Adding the theme managed by ODS Charts will then consist of doing:

```javascript
// build the theme
var themeManager = ODSCharts.getThemeManager({
  // options can be used for configuration
});

// register this theme to echarts
echarts.registerTheme(themeManager.name, themeManager.theme);

var div = document.getElementById('barLine_chart');
var myChart = echarts.init(
  div,
  themeManager.name, // initialize the chart with the generated theme
  {
    renderer: 'svg', // SVG rendered is recommended
  }
);

// enrich data options to complete implementation of the Orange Design System.
myChart.setOption(themeManager.getChartOptions(dataOptions));
```

The `themeManager` returned by `getThemeManager()` can be used to add other features supported by the ODS Charts library.
