## Quick start for users
The ODS Chart library is to be used with Apache ECharts to produce charts in line with the Orange Design System.

It has been designed to be minimally intrusive and not to interfere with the use of the Apchae Echarts library. The Apache Echarts documentation remains the reference for configuring graphics.

For example, an Apache Echarts user will initialize a graph with code like this:
```
var div = document.getElementById('barLine_chart');
var myChart = echarts.init(div, undefined, {
  renderer: 'svg', // we prefer svg renderer
});
// Display the chart.
myChart.setOption(dataOptions);
```

Adding the theme managed by ODS Charts will then consist of doing:
```
// Build the theme
var themeManager = ODSCharts.getThemeManager({
  // you can configure here some optional options
});

// register this theme to echarts
echarts.registerTheme(themeManager.name , themeManager.theme);

var div = document.getElementById('barLine_chart');
var myChart = echarts.init(div, 
  themeManager.name,  // initialized the chart with the generated theme 
  {
    renderer: 'svg', // we still prefer svg renderer
  }
);

// Enriched dataOptions to complete implementation of the Orange Design System.
myChart.setOption(themeManager.getChartOptions(dataOptions));  

```
The `themeManager` returned by `getThemeManager()` can be used to add other features supported by the ODS Charts library. Please refer to [the online documentation for more details](https://ods-charts.netlify.app/).
