# Developer guide

## Local Development

Build and watch the library:

```bash
npm i
npm run watch
```

Then launch a local server in a separate terminal:

Optionally, you can build the documentation:

```bash
npm run typedoc
```

```bash
npm run serve
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`:

- Test files are located at `http://localhost:3000/test`.
- Documentation is located at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.
